\section*{Introduction}
\paragraph{}The web could be argued to be one of the most important infrastructures in the world.
\section{Discussions from the lab}
\paragraph{}
\section{Specific questions from the lab}
\subsection{Q1}
\paragraph{Comment on security related issues regarding the cryptographic algorithms used to
generate and sign your groups web server certiﬁcate (key length, algorithm, etc.).}
\paragraph{} For the web server certificate, the signature algorithm were chosen as SHA1 with RSA encryption, with a public-key length of 2048 bits. At the current time, RSA laboratories (creators of the RSA algorithm) recommends a 2048 bits key size for extremely valuable keys, and 1024 bits key size for corporate use \cite{2}.
\subsection{Q2}
\paragraph{Explain what you have achieved through each of these veriﬁcations. What is the name of
the person signing the Apache release?}
\subsection{Q3}
\paragraph{What are the access permissions to your web server’s conﬁguration ﬁles, server certiﬁcate
and the corresponding private key? Comment on possible attacks to your web server due to
inappropriate ﬁle permissions.}
\subsection{Q4}
\paragraph{Web servers oﬀering weak cryptography are subject to several attacks. What kind of
attacks are feasible? How did you conﬁgure your server to prevent such attacks?}
\subsection{Q5}
\paragraph{What kind of malicious attacks is your web application (PHP) vulnerable to? Describe
them brieﬂy, and point out what countermeasures you have developed in your code to prevent
such attacks.}
